# xplan (source code)

This is the source code for **xplan**, a site where a user can create a grid of squares, which represent days to achieve a goal and/or establish a new habit. The user marks the day as 'complete' or 'missed' depending on how the day transpired in real life. Ultimately, once the grid is complete, it serves as a visual representation of the path that they had set on.
